## Contributing ü§ù
This project is a hobby project. For a robust, production ready code there are certain principles for cooperation in place. 
- Main branch is always protected.
  - To protect the main branch we demand a review from another member of the team before merging a PR.
    - Please wait for an accepted review, and merge the PR.
  - Main branch cannot be deleted
  - PRs to main should allways come from the **dev** branch üå≥
- Dev branch should be treated as it is protected.
  - Dev branch cannot be deleted ‚úñÔ∏è
- Allways make a new branch to add features. The new branches should allways originate from **dev** and include a prefix **feature-<branchname>**, **update-<branchname>** or **bugfix-<branchname>**
  - Allways create a PR to **dev** ‚úîÔ∏è (not **main**), and delete the branch after merging is complete.
